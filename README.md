•	As part of this coursework, I developed the front-end of a fictitious web application that allows students and their parents to search for after-school classes and activities.

•	Requirements:

      o	Sort:
      o	The user can sort by subject, location, availability or price both in ascending and descending order.

      o	Add to cart:
      o	Each lesson contains an add to cart button, which is only enabled when the available space is larger than 0.
      o	Once the button is clicked, one space is added to the shopping cart, reducing the spaces available by one.
      o	When no more space is available, the 'Add to cart' button is disabled but still visible.

      o	Shopping Cart:
      o	The shopping cart button is enabled only if at least one lesson has been added to the cart.
      o	Clicking the shopping cart button displays the items in the cart, and clicking it again returns the user to the homepage (lesson page)
      o	Lesson can be removed from the shopping cart.

      o	Check out:
      o	Checkout is included on the shopping cart page.
      o	To check out, the user must provide their name and phone number.
      o	The checkout button is hidden until a valid name and phone number have been provided.
      o	Upon clicking the checkout button, a message is displayed. Confirming the order

      o	Search:
      o	Users can perform searches by subject and location
